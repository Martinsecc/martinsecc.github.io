## From DeFi Degen to Aspiring Pentester

For a couple of years, I immersed myself in what’s arguably the riskiest thing I’ve ever done: trading crypto. More specifically, I spent my days degening around in DeFi protocols. It was chaotic, intense, and honestly, often fun. I gained the freedom to explore the world and try new things, but it came with constant uncertainty. When markets began to tank due to tariffs and broader economic instability, I knew it was time to step away.

What stuck with me, though, was a deep appreciation for the digital world and a strong sense of just how vulnerable it can be. In DeFi, scams are a daily reality. You learn to question everything, double-check every transaction, and still get caught off guard. That cautious mindset, oddly enough, planted the seed for a shift in direction.

A friend suggested I explore cybersecurity. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. I started applying to roles, only to find out that without certifications, I wouldn’t get far. I tried brushing up on the basics myself — networking, protocols, some TryHackMe labs — but I wasn’t landing interviews.

So I changed my approach.

## My Plan

I'm now dedicating myself full time to learning the skills required for OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional), my end goal.

1. **Start with Security+ (done):**  
   I passed CompTIA Security+ in two weeks. It wasn’t too difficult, but it gave me a solid foundation and confirmed that I can absorb technical material quickly. It also helped structure my understanding of core cybersecurity concepts.

2. **Next up: eJPT v2:**  
   Widely considered a solid beginner cert for aspiring pentesters, eJPT v2 will give me hands-on experience and expose gaps in my practical knowledge.

3. **Bridge the gap to OSCP:**  
   After eJPT, I’ll assess what I’m still missing and focus exclusively on bridging that gap. I’m not planning to collect more certifications just for the sake of it. OSCP is the goal, and every step I take is meant to lead there.

## And Then?

Hopefully, I’ll find a role where I can apply what I’ve learned, keep growing, and earn a living doing something I actually enjoy and that won't lead to sleepless nights.

In the meantime, I’m documenting my journey here, not just for myself, but for anyone curious about going from 0 to OSCP.
