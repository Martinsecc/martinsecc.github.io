For a couple years I spent my time doing the most risky thing I ever did in my life, trading crypto, degening to be more precise on defi protocols. It was fun, it was bad, it was a lot of stress and a lot of fun, it allowed me to try new things, travel, but it also gave a lot of worry because you have no clue what tomorrow might bring. Now, as the markets are tanking because of tarrifs and whatnot it seemed like the best moment to step away from it But crypto left in me a deep love of the digital world and an acute awareness of the risks associated with it.

Scamming is a daily occurrence in defi. You have to always be aware of what can happen, distrust everything and sometimes take a chance against better knowledge. It is that skeptic attitude that I felt could come of use when a friend of mine suggested I should try getting into cybersecurity. So I went on, applied for positions, but I noticed quickly that without certificates I would be nowhere. I tried practicing on my own the terminology and skills needed to perform in an interview, but a few tryhackme lessons later I still did not ace those. So instead I decided to get myself certified, the end goal was always to get certified to pentest since this sounds like the most interesting job to me.

My goal is as follows, spend every day full time on learning myself the skills needed to finally get OSCP:

Start with security + by comptia, which I already completed in two weeks time (though I spent some time researching networking for my job applications prior to that)

This is to gain basic knowledge. The test itself was not too hard, but it does familiarize yourself with basic concepts of cybersecurity. And it gives you a whole picture. Also it was for me a test to see how fast I can absorb this new info.

Learn eJPT v2 and pass this

eJPT has been touted as a good beginner certificate. While I am not looking to gain a job with it specifically, I want to use it as a stepping stone and test of my skills, get familiar with concepts in pentesting and learn what I need to learn.

Perform an analysis on the gap between the skills I gained from eJPT V2 and what I need for OSCP

I think there is quite a large gap between the novice skills eJPT V2 teaches you and what you need for OSCP, so I will perform an analysis of where I need to be for OSCP. I do not think I want to do another certificate in between because those are not my end goal.

Then find a job, make a lot of money, buy a mansion? Who knows, hope you enjoy the journey along with me.
